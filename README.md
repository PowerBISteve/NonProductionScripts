These are personal projects not designed for use in production environments. I offer no support and they may break in the future with no warning.

# Export DAX Timings
This flow automates the performance analyzer on each page of the report for a specified open power bi file. 
It then runs a PowerShell script and produces a CSV which contains a row per visual. 
Columns: Page (the Power BI page), Duration (Dax query duration on local machine),	RowCount (Returned Rows),	DAX (Query generated by visual)

You can the test the low performing DAX quries in DAX Studio, or add the output to a pipeline so you can automate testing all DAX queries when you make model changes. 

#### You must install Clear Cahce external tool from https://powerbi.tips/product/business-ops/

To use: \
Set variables on rows \
2 - the name of the open Power BI file \
3 - root folder name to store files \
5 - folder name, it does not have to exist \
7 - set this to 1 to allow it to empty the folder you selected

This is early version and lots of tidying to do. I probably will not do that. 
I likely will not maintain as Microsoft will update the Power BI UI and likely break the app. It may or may not continue to work.
Not reccomended in production but use at own risk. This is a personal project and I will offer no support.
